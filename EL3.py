#The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

#What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

#This keeps track of what the largest prime variable is
largestprime = 0

#this is our limiting fator that keeps track of the value we want the prime factors of 
number = 600851475143

#This keeps track of were we are in the loop factor loop
PC = 0

#keeps track of the number while we are in the prime loop
PC2 = 0

while PC <= number

	if number % PC == 0
		#Then it is a factor and we should check if it is prime
		


	#Resets PC2 and continues to count the progress through the loop
	PC2 = 0
	PC = PC + 1
